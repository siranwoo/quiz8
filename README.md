## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Inspiration: *Spotify Wrapped 2023 â€“ Dynamic Visual Posters*

The **animated curved ribbons** and smooth 3D motion in *Spotify Wrapped 2023* are visually engaging. I want to incorporate the flowing ribbon effect and vibrant gradients into my project to present data or narrative in a more emotionally expressive and playful way. This aligns with the assignmentâ€™s aim to explore design that enhances audience engagement through motion and interactivity.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

### Technique: *Kaleidoscope Effect with Repetition in p5.js*

This **p5.js kaleidoscope example** creates a captivating pattern by repeatedly rotating and mirroring triangular sections of a canvas. It reflects the kind of geometric repetition and rhythmic motion seen in Spotify Wrappedâ€™s animated visuals. I could use this technique to design dynamic, abstract visuals that react to music or data, reinforcing the wrapped themeâ€™s energy and personalization.
